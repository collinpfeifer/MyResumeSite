## Advanced Intelligence Services Inc. Internship

![solar panels](./ais.jpg)

I have been working at Advanced Intelligence Services Inc. as a web development intern for about 3 months now and it has allowed me to grow throughout my interpersonal skills along with my development skills.

I have been able to grow through my use of Node, Express and Material UI to better grow my full stack development skills. Working with the interns is easier than I thought and not at all awkward, I've been able to code, ask questions and feel like I am valued. Hopefully more good news to follow in the future.
