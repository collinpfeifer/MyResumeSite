## Fusion 92 Internship

![red car](./images/fusion92.jpg)

Unexpectedly, but amazingly, I was able to receive another internship offer through the digital marketing company Fusion 92 for their role of Software Engineer Intern. My roles will include automation testing, Azure Dev Ops and full stack web development with Vue.js and Node.js.

I am hoping that this position will help me further not only my web development career but also my computer science career in general. Allowing me to gain valuable communication skills and being able to continue working in the field I love.
